# 05-view-recent-articles-home-high

**As a** website visitor (logged in or not)  
**I want to** see recent articles on the home page with category and tag navigation  
**So that** I can discover the latest content and navigate to filtered articles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Home page displays recent articles (e.g., last 10-15 articles by default)
- Articles are displayed in a list/grid format
- Each article shows title, **author (clickable, links to author profile)**, publication date, excerpt, and category
- Author names are clickable and link to author profile pages
- Articles are sorted by most recent first
- **Categories are displayed in a secondary navigation panel** (sidebar or top navigation area)
- **All tags are listed in a side panel** (tag cloud or list format)
- **Clicking on a category in the navigation panel navigates to the articles page with that category filter applied**
- **Clicking on a tag in the side panel navigates to the articles page with that tag filter applied**
- Home page does NOT filter articles - it only shows recent articles
- Navigation to articles page preserves the selected filter (category or tag)
- Page is mobile responsive (navigation panels adapt for mobile)
- **No login required** - anyone can view the home page
- Link to "View All Articles" page is available
- **Note:** Authors are independent entities managed by admin, not user accounts
